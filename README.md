# 🌍 Global Air Pollution Analysis - Power BI Project
## 🎯 Project Objective
Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze global air quality trends based on AQI data. The report visualizes pollutant levels (PM2.5, CO, NO2, Ozone) across countries and cities, highlights average values, and identifies regions with the best and worst air quality. It enables filtering by country/city and provides insights through AQI category breakdowns, aiding environmental monitoring and decision-making.
